Sometimes small design details drive you crazy, like when a preload animation suddenly cuts out and an image pops in. After reading about <a href="https://www.viget.com/articles/ensuring-css-animations-run-and-stop-gracefully">Viget's Ensure Animation library</a>  —which ensures preload animations cycle fully through their current iterations then stop— I got curious and decided to reverse engineer it. I used jquery and the lazy loading libray <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lazysizes">lazysizes</a>. The images on this page serve as examples.
<p>

The relevant HTML looks like:

<pre>
&lt;div class="hero"> 
    &lt;img data-src="otter.jpg" class="lazyload">
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="preloader">&lt;/div>
</pre>
<p>

Using <code>data-src</code> to link to the image instead of the usual <code>src</code> and including the <code>lazyload</code> class is how you tell lazysizes to relate to that image. When lazysizes is done it will leave you with <code>&lt;img data-src="otter.jpg" class="lazyloaded"></code>, having changed the class from <code>lazyload</code> to <code>lazyloaded</code>.
<p>

This is the CSS:

<pre>
.preloader {
    z-index: 1; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; 
    animation: preloader 1s infinite ease-in-out forwards; }

.hero {
    z-index: 2; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px;
    opacity: 0; }

.fade-in {
    opacity: 1;
    transition: all .2s ease-in; }
</pre>
<p>

The image's opacity is 0 and it's stacked on top of the preload animation, so to start we only see the animation.
<p>

And here's our script:

<pre>
// use browserify to compile dependencies into build.js
require('lazysizes');
var $ = require('jquery');
	
// call the funtion once the image is loaded
$(".hero img").on("load",function() {

  // traverse to the relevant preloader element
  var preloader = $(this).parent().next();
	
  // call the function when the animation finishes its current iteration
  $(preloader).on('animationiteration webkitAnimationIteration', function(){

    // pause the animation
    $(this).css("animation-play-state", "paused");

    // traverse to the relevant .hero element
    var hero = $(this).prev();
	
    // add the fade-in class to fade the image in
    $(hero).addClass("fade-in");

  }); 

});	
</pre>
<p>

You might expect I would trigger the whole thing by waiting for the <code>lazyloaded</code> class to load. Unfortunately lazysizes displays a strange behavior where it adds a space before the class (<code>class=" lazyloaded"</code>), making it impossible to target. I went with <code>".hero img"</code>, which seems fine but feels a little less to the point.
<p>

Once our image loads we traverse the DOM to target its corresponding <code>.preloader</code> element. If we didn't traverse here the script would target all <code>.preloader</code> elements, which would likely reveal some images before they're fully loaded.
<p>

Next we use <code>animationiteration</code> to wait for the preload animation to finish its current iteration then call a function that pauses the animation, traverses the DOM back to the image's parent <code>.hero</code> element, and makes the image visible by adding the <code>fade-in</code> class.
<p>

There are a couple unsolved mysteries left. Firstly the animation always seems to run for a minimum of two cycles even when you'd expect the image to load faster. Though this is only true for the image that's in the viewport when you load the page, as you scroll down the images can load faster. The second issue is when I throttle my internet connection the animation stops after its next iteration has begun, which ruins the whole dang thing. This also only happens to the image that's in the viewport when the page loads.
<p>

Overall it's not too complicated, but I always learn something when I do stuff like this. I was ignorant of the inner workings of CSS animations. I was trying to figure out how Ensure Animation works and when I inspected element and saw the <code>animation-iteration-count</code> counting away it was a bit of a revelation. It seems obvious that if you've got iterations they've got to be counted but I guess I was just so used to HTML-CSS being static that it didn't occur to me. At first I tried to set the iteration count to 0 to stop the animation, which worked on chrome but not safari, then I dug around and found <code>animation-play-state: paused;</code>, which did the trick.
